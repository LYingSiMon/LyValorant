这个程序是我打发时间的产物，其主要目的在于让自己玩游戏有更多的快感。
This program is the product of my leisure time, with its primary purpose being to enhance my own enjoyment while playing games.

很抱歉我没有在第一时间开源他，因为我不想对游戏公司造成伤害，这是我不想看到的。
I apologize for not open-sourcing it initially, as I was hesitant to potentially cause harm to game companies, which is something I wish to avoid.

由于最近有其他事情要忙，这个项目已经不在维护了，当然这意味着你无法在最新的游戏客户端上使用它。
Due to recent commitments occupying my time, this project is no longer being maintained. Consequently, it means that it cannot be used on the latest game clients.

但我想也许有人会对这些代码感兴趣，或者能够帮助到那些对逆向工程感兴趣的初学者，所以此代码仅以学习为目的，请勿用于非法用途。
However, I thought that perhaps someone might find interest in these codes, or they could be helpful to beginners curious about reverse engineering. Thus, this code is shared solely for educational purposes; please refrain from using it for any illegal activities.
